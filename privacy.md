When you supply your personal details to this clinic they are stored and processed for 4 reasons.

We ask personal health information about your health in order to provide you with the best possible treatment.  Your requesting treatment and our agreement to provide that care constitutes a contract.

We have a Legitimate Interest in collecting that information because without it we could not do our job effectively and safely.  We may also need to contact you in order to confirm or change your appointment or update you on matters related to your medical care.  This is therefore in your legitimate interest.
With your consent, we could send you requested information, advice or a newsletter.  This consent can be refused or withdrawn at any time.

We have a Legal Obligation to retain your records for 8 years after your most recent appointment (or age 25, if this is longer), but after this period you can ask us to delete/destroy your records if you wish.

Your records will be stored on paper, in a locked filing cabinet and in locked offices out of working hours.  We will never share your data without your written consent.  You have the right to see what personal data of yours we have, and you can also ask us to correct any factual errors.  You can be confident we treat your personal data responsibly and that we do everything we can to make sure that the only people who can access that data are your practitioners.

If you feel that we are mishandling your personal data in some way, you have the right to complain.
Complaints need to be sent to the ‘Data Controller’: 

Diane Kane  
07312 919840  
46, Chester Road  
Wrexham   
LL11 2SD  


Because we only use paper records we do not have to register with the Information Commissioner’s Office.

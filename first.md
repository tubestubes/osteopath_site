I qualified from the European School of Osteopathy and have worked in N.E. Wales and Chester since.  Although I am trained in using all osteopathic techniques, I have over time developed a particular interest in using the gentle, subtle techniques.

# What to expect during your first appointment

In order to understand as much as possible, it is important to take a case history detailing not just the current complaint, but also any previous problems or injury.  It is natural to be anxious about your symptoms so Iâ€™ll take time to listen and to ask questions.

I will then examine the areas causing discomfort and if other areas appear to be influencing your problem, I will examine these areas also.  Because I need to see and feel how our body moves, you will be asked to remove some layers of clothing, often to underwear. You can, of course, request to leaving clothing on or shorts can be provided.  During treatment you are covered with a towel.  I will explain my finding to you and give advice on home management if necessary.
